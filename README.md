## Introduction
This project was a 2 week sprint where our team completed a Minimum Viable Product re-design for a clients E-Commerce platform based off of a provided Business Requirements Document.

In this project, I was in charge of the Questions and Answers module and tracking team progress.

## What does the app do?
* Interfaces with an API to display millions of clothing products to users
* Users can add items to their shopping cart after selecting a size and quantity as well as select from a list of related items to view
* Provides a list of questions and answers for each product with the ability to add new entries to both
* Displays detailed information on the review score of each item and allows users to add their own reviews
